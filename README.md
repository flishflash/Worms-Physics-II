## Controls ##
  ENTER = Change scene
 1. Choose type of block:
    - 1 = ground
    - 2 = water
    - 3 = air
 2. Right click to put a block
 3. Movement (only once you put a block):
    - A = Left
    - D = Right
    - S = Stop Player
    - Space = Jump(one x turn)
 4. Left click to shoot (only once you put a block)

## Debug Keys ##

 - F1 = Turn Player 1
 - F2 = Turn Player 2
 - m = Clear Map
 - F3 = Enter debug mode
 In debug mode you can:
  - Mantain pressed G:
    - UP = gravity y valor + 0.5
    - DOWN = gravity y valor - 0.5
    - 0 = Desactivate gravity
    - R = Restart gravity
  - Mantain pressed W:
    - UP = wind y valor + 0.5
    - DOWN = wind y valor - 0.5
    - RIGHT = wind x valor + 0.5
    - LEFT = wind x valor - 0.5
    - 0 = Desactivate wind
    - R = Restart wind
    - V = Activate wind
  - Mantain pressed B:
    - UP = Bouyancy y valor + 0.5
    - DOWN = Bouyancy y valor - 0.5
    - RIGHT = Bouyancy x valor + 0.5
    - LEFT = Bouyancy x valor - 0.5
    - 0 = Desactivate Bouyancy
    - R = Restart Bouyancy
    - A = Water level Up
  - C = Activate or desactivate friction
  - Mantain pressed f:
    - UP = fps + 10
    - DOWN = fps - 10
  - Mantain I = Choose type of integrator:
    - 1 = Verlet
    - 2 = BWS Euler
    - 3 = FWS EULER
  - Mantain P = Choose type of Movement:
    - 1 = Changing x
    - 2 = Fixed velocity
 - F4 = Win P1
 - F5 = Win P2
